I am new to codeforces therefor I am first trying to a few 800 (easiest) rated problem.
Will solve some 25 easiest rated problems and then level up subsequently.
Although the easy problems are not posing any challenge as far as the solution is conserned but I have noticed that I am taking more time to solve than what I would have liked , I should have been solve this problems under 5 minutes but to my surprise some problems are consuming even 15 mins.
I think this is because i am not used to solve these story like problems , (in leetcode the problems where not in the form of story).
I am also keeping track of the time which I have never done before.
I have also hidden the test topics of the problem , so that I may not get any hint in the beginning , although for 800 rated problem topics is not required.

also i have to code to read inputs from the user which was not required leetcode or hackerank.
Overall I think the platform is good as it forces us to write correct code in as many few tries as possible.
alos there are less distractions in the platform due to its plain ui.
